//given an array of integers, num[], and a target integer, target
//return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target 
//assume each input has exactly oen solution 
//do not use the same element twice
// Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

//Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

Iteration 1
Mark the num[0]
Ad num[0] to every other index
If num[0] + num[n] != target, we go to num[1] andd repeat the process
...going to num[2], num[3] and so on
